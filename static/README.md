This directory contains static files generated by the Bitbucket LOC Analyzer Web UI.

## Structure

- `/data` - CSV files containing analysis results
- `/images` - Charts and visualizations generated from the analysis

These directories are populated when running analyses through the web UI.
They are automatically created if they don't exist.
