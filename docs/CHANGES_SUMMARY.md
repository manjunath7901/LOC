# Changes Made for Bearer Token and CLOC Integration

## Authentication Changes
1. Removed username/password authentication
2. Made Bearer token authentication the only supported method
3. Simplified token handling and error messaging

## CLOC Integration
1. Added methods to use the CLOC command-line tool for more accurate LOC statistics
2. Implemented repository archive downloading for CLOC comparison
3. Added fallback mechanisms when CLOC isn't available
4. Added a command-line option to control CLOC usage (enabled by default)

## Other Improvements
1. Added improved error handling for authentication failures
2. Created a test script for the new features (test_bearer_token_cloc.sh)
3. Added comprehensive documentation in BEARER_TOKEN_CLOC_USAGE.md
4. Created a new VS Code task specifically for Bearer token authentication and CLOC
5. Added checks to ensure CLOC is installed

## How to Verify Changes
1. Run the test script: `./test_bearer_token_cloc.sh`
2. Use the VS Code task "Run Bitbucket LOC Analyzer with Bearer Token and CLOC"
3. Check that the CLOC statistics match your expectations
4. Verify that the output CSV file contains accurate LOC changes
