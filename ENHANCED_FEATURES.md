    return false;
}
```

**Tab Navigation:**

// Dynamic tab switching
tabButtons.forEach(button => {
    button.addEventListener('click', function() {
        // Switch tabs dynamically
    });
});
```

**Progress Polling:**
```javascript
// Real-time progress updates
function checkStatus() {
    fetch(`/status/${analysisId}`)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            // Update progress bar and status
        });
